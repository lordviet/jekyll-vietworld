## What is CS50?

Currently there is a limitless number of online courses and tutorials. CS50 is one of the best ones out there that will push you to the limit and ultimately make you a better programmer. It is a Harvard Course that one can take for free in edx. 

It has 9 weeks of content with different programming tasks. In the beginning, it covers the basics of C programming where you learn about functions, pointers and structs. Afterwards it moves to Python and Javascript. It is really challenging because the tasks are really different and made in such a way that you have to think to solve them. They are different and interesting. 

Although it is a hard course and quite time-consuming, I can not recommend it enough. It helped me a lot on my journey. CS50 shows the different faces of computer science and by the end you may find which one suits you the best.
