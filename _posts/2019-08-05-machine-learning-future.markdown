## Why Machine Learning is the future?
We are currently living in a very exciting age. Things that weren't thought possible are happening.
This is the age of technology, the age of innovation. Machine Learning is a vital part in all of this.
But what is ML? Is it just a trendy word or is is something that may change everything as we know it?

According to wikipedia Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. 

Although this may sound a bit too dry, ML is one of the most astonishing subsets of computer science.
It is a fusion between mathematics, statistics and programming.

Algorithms can know predict outcomes without the intervention of human beings. Some people are afraid that this technology is disrupting industries. While they are correct in a way, this isn't a bad thing because new jobs will emerge. If we think about it jobs such as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Digital marketer are entirely new. This is a logical step and it has happened countless times before. Every industrial revolution has been followed by new jobs. 

### Types of Machine learning algorithms
There are three different ML algorithms available.
1. Supervised learning - In these algorithms, we have both the input and the output. We train the algorithm so that it can predict what the output will be.
2. Unsupervised learning - In unsupervised learning, we have only the input and the algorithm learns from plain examples, determing data patterns on its own.
3. Reinforcement Learning - Simillar to unsupervised learning with the difference that we can give a negative or positive feedback to the output. In human words, it is just like learning by trial and error.
