<p>When starting out, many people are confused with what programming language to start with. I will try to clear this confusion once and for all by giving my 2 cents on the topic.</p>

<p>The truth is that the programming language does not matter that much. Howver, one will always have a special attachment to their first language. In my case that is JavaScript. Since then I’ve written on a handful of other languages but nothing can beat that initial feeling of accomplishment when first solving a hard task.</p>

<p>In my opinion, one should choose one language and stick with it for a while to learn its quirks and specifics. Some may argue that it is best to start with C or C++ but I do not think that this is a good idea. When starting out, a lot of people feel intimidated by writing code. If we add a non-beginner friendly language to the picture things can get rough pretty quick. I have friends who have rediscovered their passion for programming after switching to an easier language.</p>

<p>That’s why I think it is better to start with something like JavaScript or Python where the syntax is easy and memory management and other things are happening behind the curtains. Thus, one can learn the problem solving methodology that will help them onwards with their careers.</p>

<p>That being said, once one feels comfortable enough in their basic understanding of the language, I think that it is essential to move and try different languages to broaden their horizons. C/C++ are the go to place for learning memory management and haskell is among the best options for functional programming.</p>

<p>In the end, the most important thing is to start writing code and stick to it.</p>
