            <h2 id="why-machine-learning-is-the-future">Why Machine Learning is the future?</h2>
<p>We are currently living in a very exciting age. Things that weren’t thought possible are happening.
This is the age of technology, the age of innovation. Machine Learning is a vital part in all of this.
But what is ML? Is it just a trendy word or is is something that may change everything as we know it?</p>

<p>According to wikipedia Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.</p>

<p>Although this may sound a bit too dry, ML is one of the most astonishing subsets of computer science.
It is a fusion between mathematics, statistics and programming.</p>

<p>Algorithms can know predict outcomes without the intervention of human beings. Some people are afraid that this technology is disrupting industries. While they are correct in a way, this isn’t a bad thing because new jobs will emerge. If we think about it jobs such as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Digital marketer are entirely new. This is a logical step and it has happened countless times before. Every industrial revolution has been followed by new jobs.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-machine-learning-algorithms">Types of Machine learning algorithms</h3>
<p>There are three different ML algorithms available.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Supervised learning - In these algorithms, we have both the input and the output. We train the algorithm so that it can predict what the output will be.</li>
  <li>Unsupervised learning - In unsupervised learning, we have only the input and the algorithm learns from plain examples, determing data patterns on its own.</li>
  <li>Reinforcement Learning - Simillar to unsupervised learning with the difference that we can give a negative or positive feedback to the output. In human words, it is just like learning by trial and error.</li>
</ol>
