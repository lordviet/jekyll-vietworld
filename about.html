        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <p>My name is Dimitar and after 10000 years of postponing I finally decided to create a blog.</p>
        <p>I am a developer interested in Machine Learning, Web Dev and Clean Code.</p>
        <p>I co-founded the start-up LEA, winner of several awards including: "JA's Best Student Start-Up in Bulgaria for 2016".</p>
        <p>Vieta is my favourite mathematician.</p>

        <h2>About the blog</h2>
        <p>The blog follows my ongoing journey of becoming a better developer.</p>
        <p>As well as my thoughts and misconceptions about the world.</p>
        <p>Tech enthusiasts, nerds, readers, entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>If any of these resonate with you, strap in and come with me on the journey of cleaning my mind.</p>
